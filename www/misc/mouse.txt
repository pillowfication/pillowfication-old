A Mouse

There was a mouse named Rachel. Rachel's mom left at might-night. Befor she left she left she wrote a letter that siad: "Dear Rachel please get your own breakfast. Be careful from the cat. Love Mom."

When Rachel went to the cat, she jumed on the cat's head and got her breakfast and ate it before his mom came home. Her mom almost caught her not eating the carrot witch was her breakfast.

Then she played with her friends. She play 1,003 games with her 90 friends. Rachel didn't know the cat was tip-towing to her but she kept on playing.

The cat jumped on Rachel. Rachel was scared so she ran. The cat chased Rachel. The cat bumped into a carrat the cat ate because the cat thought it was Rachel. Rachel went home.
